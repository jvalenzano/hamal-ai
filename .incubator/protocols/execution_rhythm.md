# The Execution Rhythm Protocol
> **"Validation is not the finish line."**

This protocol defines the mandatory operating cadence for any venture in the Incubator.

## 1. The Weekly Review (Friday)
**Duration:** 30 Minutes
**Goal:** Close the loop.

*   **Review:** Did we ship what we promised on Monday?
*   **Reflect:** What did we learn? (Validation signals, friction points).
*   **Score:** Pass/Fail on the "One Metric That Matters".

## 2. The Monday Commit
**Duration:** 15 Minutes
**Goal:** Set the intent.

*   **Define:** The 3 "Big Rocks" for the week.
*   **Block:** Schedule deep work sessions.

## 3. The "One Metric That Matters" (OMTM)
Every venture must track **one** number that indicates progress.
*   *Validation Phase:* # of Customer Interviews or "Validation Signals".
*   *Build Phase:* # of Core Features Shipped or "Weekly Active Users".

## 4. The Artifact: `weekly_log.md`
Each week, append a new entry to `ventures/{venture}/memory/logs/weekly_log.md`:

```markdown
### Week {N} - {Date}
**Focus:** {Theme}
**OMTM:** {Value}

**Did we ship?**
- [ ] Item 1
- [ ] Item 2

**Learnings:**
- ...

**Next Week's Commit:**

```
