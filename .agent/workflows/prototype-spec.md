# Workflow: Prototype Spec

This workflow prepares the "Build" instructions for an AI coder.

## Step 1: Core Feature List (MVP)
**Agent Task:** Define the absolute minimum feature set to solve the core problem.
**Constraint:** "If it's nice to have, cut it."

## Step 2: User Flows
**Agent Task:** Describe the critical path (Start -> Success state).

## Step 3: Implementation Road Map
**Agent Task:** Break down work into atomic tasks (Todo list).

## Step 4: Deliverable
**Agent Task:** Create `hamal-framework/04-prototyping/[idea-name]-spec.md` containing:
1.  MVP Feature List
2.  Critical User Flow
3.  `implementation_plan.md` draft
