# Workflow: Validate Idea

This workflow tests the assumptions made during research.

## Step 1: User Avatar Creation
**Agent Task:** specialized agent defines the "Perfect Customer" (ICP).
**Output:** A persona description (pain points, goals, budget).

## Step 2: Key Assumption Checks
**Agent Task:** Identify the 3 riskiest assumptions (e.g., "People will pay for X").
**Agent Task:** Propose validation experiments (e.g., landing page, manual concierge MVP, Reddit post).

## Step 3: The "Mom Test" Simulation
**Agent Task:** Simulate a conversation with a skeptical potential user.
**Goal:** Identify where the value proposition falls flat.

## Step 4: Deliverable
**Agent Task:** Create `hamal-framework/02-validation/[idea-name]-validation.md` containing:
1.  Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)
2.  Risk Register (Top 3 Risks)
3.  Proposed Experiments
4.  Validation Score (0-10)
