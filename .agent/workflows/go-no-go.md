# Workflow: Go / No-Go

This workflow forces a decision based on evidence.

## Step 1: Evidence Review
**Agent Task:** Summarize findings from Research (01), Validation (02), and Architecture (03).

## Step 2: Hamal Score Calculation
**Agent Task:** Score the idea on:
*   Feasibility (Can we build it?)
*   Desirability (Do they want it?)
*   Viability (Business case?)

## Step 3: Decision
**Agent Task:** Recommend one of:
*   🟢 **GO:** Proceed to build (Project -> `ventures/[name]`)
*   🟡 **PIVOT:** Adjust standard or target audience.
*   🔴 **NO-GO:** Archive learnings.

## Step 4: Deliverable
**Agent Task:** Create `hamal-framework/05-decision/[idea-name]-decision.md`.
