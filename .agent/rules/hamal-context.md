# Hamal Project Context

> **CRITICAL:** When resuming work on this project, ALWAYS read `NORTH_STAR.md` first to ground yourself in the current strategy.

## Core Principles
1.  **Hamal is the Product:** Our goal is to build the "Solopreneur Idea Factory" framework/software.
2.  **Echo is the Test Case:** "Project Echo" is simply the first idea we are running through the factory to prove the machinery works. Do not get distracted by building Echo features unless they serve the purpose of validating Hamal.
3.  **Validation First:** We do not build software until we have rigorous evidence (Research -> Validation -> Architecture).
