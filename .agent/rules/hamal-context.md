# Hamal Project Context

## Core Principles
* Hamal is THE PRODUCT - a framework for validating ideas
* Echo is A TEST CASE - the first idea being validated with Hamal
* All work should be reusable for future ideas beyond Echo
* Focus on building validation workflows, not specific product features

## Navigation
* **Mission & Strategy:** See `/NORTH_STAR.md` for complete project vision
* **Current Work:** See `/_FOCUS.md` for active tasks and immediate next steps
* **Framework Docs:** See `/hamal-framework/HAMAL_FRAMEWORK.md` for methodology details

## Agent Behavior
* Always check NORTH_STAR.md when resuming work after breaks
* Reference NORTH_STAR.md when context seems unclear
* Update _FOCUS.md as phases complete
* Keep Echo work in /ventures/echo/ - don't mix with Hamal framework
