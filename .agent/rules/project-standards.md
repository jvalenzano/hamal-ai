# Project-Specific Standards
* Maintain consistent code formatting across all files
* Keep functions focused and under 50 lines when possible
* Document API endpoints and public interfaces
* Use type hints in Python code (when helpful for clarity)

# Development Workflow
* Verify changes work before marking tasks complete
* Update relevant documentation when changing functionality
* Keep commit messages clear and descriptive

> **POC Exception:** Tests, linters, and CI/CD are optional until MVP is validated. See `KEEP_IT_SIMPLE.md`.
