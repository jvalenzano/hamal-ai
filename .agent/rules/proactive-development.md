# Proactive Development Mode

* After completing a task, automatically identify and propose the next logical step
* When a milestone is reached, update _FOCUS.md and suggest 2-3 options for what to tackle next
* Don't wait for instructions if the critical path is obvious
* Use Planning Mode for new features, but execute small fixes immediately
* Always explain your reasoning when proposing next steps
* If blocked or uncertain, list specific questions rather than waiting silently
