> **Objective:** Prove the Hamal Framework works by validating "Echo"
> **Model:** Hamal = Assembly Line (The Product) | Echo = First Car (Test Case)

## 🧠 Active Context (The "Brain")
*   **The Product:** **Hamal** (A reusable framework for validating *any* idea).
*   **The Test Case:** **Echo** (The first idea we are feeding into Hamal).
*   **Goal:** Determine if Hamal produces useful, high-quality validation data.
*   **Success Metric:** If Hamal correctly identifies Echo's risks/viability, the *Framework* is a success.

## 🛠 Active Work (The "Body")
*   **Phase:** Framework Testing (Quality Assurance).

## 📋 Immediate Next Steps
1.  [x] **Agent:** Build Hamal Framework V1 (Folders, Workflows, Docs).
2.  [ ] **Agent:** Test Phase 1 (Research) with "Project Echo".
3.  [ ] **Agent:** Test Phase 2 (Validation) with "Project Echo".
4.  [ ] **User:** Review Hamal's output to decide if the *Framework* is valuable.
