# 🎯 CURRENT FOCUS

> **Objective:** Resume Echo/Hamal deployment to Render.com
> **Status:** Restructuring Complete - Preparing for Deployment

## 🧠 Active Context (The "Brain")
*   **Repo:** Local Git not initialized yet.
*   **Deployment:** `render.yaml` exists in `hamal-ai/`.
*   **Stack:** FastAPI + React + Render (Backend) + Vercel (Frontend).

## 🛠 Active Work (The "Body")
*   **Phase:** Workspace Verification & Git Initialization.

## 📋 Immediate Next Steps
1.  [x] **Agent:** Initialize Git (`git init`).
2.  [x] **Agent:** Create/Update `.gitignore`.
3.  [x] **Agent:** Stage and Commit all files (`Hamal Structure Baseline`).
4.  [x] **User:** Provide GitHub Repository URL.
5.  [x] **Agent:** Push code (Done - Forced Update).
6.  [ ] **User:** **DEPLOYMENT ACTION REQUIRED** - Log in to Render.com and trigger deployment for `hamal-ai` (or `hamal-api`).
    *   Since this is a fresh push, you may need to manually trigger "Manual Deploy" -> "Clear Build Cache & Deploy" if the auto-deploy doesn't catch it immediately, or if the service was previously failing.
