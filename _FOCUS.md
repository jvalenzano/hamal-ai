> **Objective:** Hamal Framework validation COMPLETE
> **Model:** Hamal = Assembly Line (The Product) | Echo = First Car (Test Case)

## ✅ Validation Complete

**All 5 phases executed successfully:**
- [x] Phase 1: Research → `hamal-framework/01-research/echo-research.md`
- [x] Phase 2: Validation → `hamal-framework/02-validation/echo-validation.md`
- [x] Phase 3: Architecture → `hamal-framework/03-architecture/echo-architecture.md`
- [x] Phase 4: Prototyping → `hamal-framework/04-prototyping/echo-spec.md`
- [x] Phase 5: Decision → `hamal-framework/05-decision/echo-decision.md`

**Final Report:** [HAMAL_VALIDATION_COMPLETE.md](./HAMAL_VALIDATION_COMPLETE.md)

## 🎯 Echo Decision: CONDITIONAL GO

**Recommendation:** Proceed to MVP Build (8 weeks)

**Key Conditions:**
1. Software-first (PWA, no hardware for MVP)
2. Local-first privacy as differentiator
3. Target Obsidian power users
4. Validate with Mom Test interviews during build

## 🤖 Agent Orchestration
> **Canonical Agent:** Antigravity (with Claude models) is the single coordinating agent for this workspace.
> **External Tools:** Claude Code CLI may be used for deep-dive coding, but all changes flow back through Antigravity for review, verification, and integration.

## 📋 Next Steps (Choose Path)

### Path A: Build Echo MVP
1. [ ] Set up development environment
2. [ ] Create GitHub repo for Echo
3. [ ] Execute Phase A-D implementation (8 weeks)
4. [ ] Conduct 5 Mom Test interviews in parallel

### Path B: Test Hamal on Another Idea
1. [ ] Select second validation target
2. [ ] Run 5-phase process again
3. [ ] Confirm framework reusability

### Path C: Productize Hamal Framework
1. [ ] Package as methodology (templates, docs)
2. [ ] OR build software product (workflow automation)
