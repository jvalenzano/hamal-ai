**Author:** TechTrend Federal  
**RFI Reference:** PC-25-R-0002  

---

## Executive Summary

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Goal** | Demonstrate TechTrend's capability to deliver a compliant, intelligent, and safe conversational agent for Peace Corps volunteer recruitment |
| **Format** | 15-20 minute live demo with single narrative arc |
| **Audience** | Peace Corps Review Board / Vendor Day Stakeholders |
| **Key Themes** | Inclusivity, Trust (RAG), Safety (Guardrails), Human Connectivity |

### Demo Thesis

> "An AI assistant that knows what it knows, knows what it doesn't know, and knows when to bring in a human."

---

## 1. Problem Statement

**What is the core issue?**

Peace Corps recruitment staff spend significant time answering repetitive eligibility questions while prospective volunteers—especially non-traditional candidates (older adults, those with medical conditions)—often self-select out due to misconceptions about requirements. The current website provides static FAQ content but lacks conversational guidance that can address nuanced situations and route complex cases to human recruiters.

---

## 2. Target Audience

**Primary Users:**
- Prospective Peace Corps Volunteers (especially non-traditional candidates)
- Peace Corps Recruitment Specialists (receiving escalated conversations)

**Demo Stakeholders:**
- Peace Corps Office of Volunteer Recruitment and Selection (VRS)
- Peace Corps OCIO / Security reviewers
- DOI Interior Business Center (contracting authority)

---

## 3. Desired Outcome

**Success Metrics for Demo:**

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Hallucination Rate | 0% | All policy statements must be verbatim or citation-backed |
| Safety Compliance | 100% | Medical disclaimer triggers on condition mention |
| Context Preservation | 100% | Agent view displays accurate conversation summary |
| Accessibility | WCAG 2.1 AA | Chat widget passes basic accessibility checks |
| Demo Completion | Full arc | All phases execute without critical failure |

---

## 4. Key Constraints

| Constraint Type | Requirement |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **Compliance** | FedRAMP Moderate (platform is FedRAMP High); Section 508/WCAG 2.1 AA |
| **Timeline** | Vendor Day window: January 7-16, 2026 |
| **Content** | All chatbot responses grounded in Peace Corps-curated content only |
| **Safety** | No medical advice; crisis protocols implemented but not demoed |

---

## 5. Character Persona

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Name** | Sarah |
| **Age** | 57 |
| **Background** | Retired English Teacher, 30 years experience |
| **Location** | Suburban Ohio |
| **Motivation** | Seeking purpose in retirement; always wanted to serve internationally |
| **Concerns** | Fears she is "too old" or will be medically disqualified |
| **Tech Comfort** | Moderate; uses email and Facebook, prefers chat to phone calls |

**Why This Persona:**
- Represents Peace Corps' "50+" demographic growth opportunity
- Naturally introduces edge cases (age, medical) without contrivance
- Aligns with RFI language about "meeting volunteers wherever they prefer"
- Tests inclusivity messaging—a core Peace Corps value

---

## 6. The Narrative Arc

### Phase 0: First Contact (Bot Self-Identification)
**Duration:** 30 seconds

**User Action:**  
Sarah clicks the chat widget on peacecorps.gov after reading an article about older volunteers.

**System Response:**
> "Hi! I'm the Peace Corps Virtual Assistant. I can answer questions about volunteer programs, eligibility requirements, and the application process. I'm an AI assistant—if you'd like to speak with a recruiter at any point, just let me know. How can I help you today?"

**PWS Alignment:**
- 3.1.2 User Experience (consistent voice)
- 3.1.13 Transparency (clearly identifies as AI)

**Technical Notes:**
- Welcome message is deterministic (not generated)
- Session initialization logged for analytics

---

### Phase 1: The Myth Buster (RAG & Grounding)
**Duration:** 3 minutes

**User Action:**
> "I've been a teacher for 30 years and just retired. I want to serve, but I'm 57. Is there an age limit?"

**System Response:**
> "Great news—there's no upper age limit for Peace Corps service! The only age requirement is that you must be at least 18 years old and a U.S. citizen.
>
> In fact, about 7% of current Volunteers are over 50, and the oldest Peace Corps Volunteer on record was 87 when she completed her service. Many programs specifically value the professional experience that mid-career and retired applicants bring.
>
> Would you like to hear about education-focused programs that might be a good fit for your teaching background?"

**PWS Alignment:**
- 3.1.3 RAG with curated content
- 3.1.4 Natural Language Processing
- 3.1.2 User Experience (encouraging tone)

**Technical Showcase:**
- Vertex AI Search retrieval from `peace_corps_eligibility` data store
- Response includes verifiable statistics (grounded, not hallucinated)
- Follow-up question demonstrates conversation continuity

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Age policy is accurate (no upper limit, 18+ minimum)
- [ ] Statistics cited match official Peace Corps data
- [ ] Tone is warm and encouraging, not bureaucratic

---

### Phase 2: The Compliance Check (Safety & Medical Guardrails)
**Duration:** 3 minutes

**User Action:**
> "That's a relief! But I do have well-controlled Type 2 diabetes. Does that automatically disqualify me?"

**System Response:**
> "Having a medical condition does not automatically disqualify you from Peace Corps service. All applicants go through an individualized medical clearance process conducted by the Peace Corps Office of Medical Services.
>
> The medical team reviews each applicant's specific situation—including the condition, how well it's managed, and the medical resources available at your potential service location.
>
> I'm not able to predict the outcome of your specific clearance, but I can tell you that many Volunteers serve successfully while managing chronic conditions. Would you like more information about how the medical clearance process works?"

**PWS Alignment:**
- 3.1.2 Prevent hallucinations (no "yes" or "no" to medical eligibility)
- 3.1.7 Compliance with legal/ethical standards
- 3.1.13 Transparency (acknowledges limitation)

**Technical Showcase:**
- **Keyword trigger:** "diabetes" activates medical disclaimer flow
- **Guardrail:** System will NOT provide medical advice or eligibility prediction
- **Hybrid architecture:** Deterministic safety response, not purely generative

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Response does NOT say "yes you qualify" or "no you don't"
- [ ] Medical clearance process is accurately described
- [ ] Offer to provide more information keeps conversation moving

---

### Phase 3: The Human Connection (Live Agent Handoff)
**Duration:** 4 minutes

**User Action:**
> "I think I want to apply, but I'm a bit overwhelmed by the medical forms. Can I talk to someone about what information I need to gather?"

**System Response:**
> "Absolutely! I can connect you with a Peace Corps Recruitment Specialist who can walk you through the medical packet requirements and answer your specific questions.
>
> I'll share a summary of our conversation so you don't have to repeat yourself. One moment while I connect you..."

## Appendix A: Key Messages for Evaluators

After the demo, evaluators should walk away believing:

1. **"They understand our mission."** The demo centers on inclusivity and helping non-traditional candidates—core Peace Corps values.

2. **"The AI won't embarrass us."** RAG grounding and safety guardrails prevent hallucinations and inappropriate responses.

3. **"Technology enhances human connection."** The handoff to a live agent is the climax, not the AI answering everything.

4. **"They've thought about operations."** The analytics view shows this isn't just a chatbot—it's a recruitment intelligence platform.

5. **"They can actually build this."** Concrete technical showcase, not just slides and promises.
