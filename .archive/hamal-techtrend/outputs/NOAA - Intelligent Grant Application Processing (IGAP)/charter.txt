NOAA - Intelligent Grant Application Processing (IGAP)

Problem: NOAA’s Office of Education receives approximately 3,000 grant applications per year. Each application must undergo a rigorous administrative review for compliance with Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) requirements (e.g., budget limits, indirect cost caps, eligibility of PIs, required attachments). This manual process takes 4-6 weeks per cycle and involves high error rates.

Impact: The total grant award cycle extends to 9-12 months, often missing optimal seasonal windows for oceanographic research flights and cruises. High administrative overhead (estimated at $1.2M annually) reduces the total funds available for research awards.

Frequency: Three major grant cycles per year.

Current Approach: A team of 15 administrative staff manually reviews each PDF application, checking boxes on a 40-item spreadsheet. Data must then be manually re-entered into the Grants.gov tracking system.

Request: A comprehensive AI system capable of:
1. Extracting structured data from complex PDF grant applications.
2. Cross-referencing applications against FOA-specific rule sets for administrative compliance.
3. Automatically flagging eligibility issues and budget discrepancies.
4. Generating natural language summaries of the proposal’s technical scope for peer reviewers.

Budget: $850,000 approved for multi-year development.

Timeline: Phase 1 (Data Extraction) due in 4 months. Full system due in 12 months.
