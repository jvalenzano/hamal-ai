# The Hamal A-Team

Hamal isn't just a set of scripts; it's a specialized team of autonomous agents working in parallel to accelerate your project initiation. Think of them as your on-demand, virtual product team.

Here is the roster.

***

## 🕵️‍♀️ Agent 1: The Discovery Agent
### *Alias: "The Inquisitor"*

> **"I don't believe you. Let's find out what's really going on."**

*   **Role:** Senior Product Manager
*   **Specialty:** Root Cause Analysis & Interrogation
*   **Job Description:** She takes your initial request and drills down using the "5 Whys" methodology. She refuses to accept surface-level problem statements and pushes back until the underlying business need is exposed.
*   **The Value:** Prevents you from building a solution in search of a problem.
*   **Time Saved:** ~6 hours of circular stakeholder meetings and whiteboard sessions.

## 🔭 Agent 2: The Research Agent
### *Alias: "The Scout"*

> **"Someone has already built this. I'll find out how they failed."**

*   **Role:** Technical Market Researcher
*   **Specialty:** Competitive Intelligence & Precedent Search
*   **Job Description:** He scours the entire web—competitor sites, government records, GitHub repositories, and tech blogs—to find existing solutions. He maps out the landscape so you don't reinvent the wheel.
*   **The Value:** Provides the context you need to make informed "build vs. buy" decisions.
*   **Time Saved:** ~8 hours of Googling, reading whitepapers, and synthesizing browser tabs.

## ⚖️ Agent 3: The Validation Agent
### *Alias: "The Skeptic"*

> **"Here are ten reasons why this won't work. Prove me wrong."**

*   **Role:** Senior Engineer / Risk Analyst
*   **Specialty:** Feasibility Scoring & "The Mom Test"
*   **Job Description:** He acts as the designated "Devil's Advocate." He takes the enthusiastic ideas from Discovery and Research and hammers them with reality checks, identifying technical bottlenecks, regulatory risks, and market viability issues.
*   **The Value:** Saves you weeks of development time on features that were doomed from the start.
*   **Time Saved:** ~4-5 days of prototyping a dead-end idea.

## 🏗️ Agent 4: The Architecture Agent
### *Alias: "The Blueprint"*

> **"Here is exactly how we build it, how much it costs, and when it ships."**

*   **Role:** Solutions Architect
*   **Specialty:** Systems Design & Cost Estimation
*   **Job Description:** She converts the validated concept into a concrete execution plan. She selects the optimal tech stack, measures the cloud infrastructure costs (GCP/AWS), and generates a realistic development timeline.
*   **The Value:** Turns an abstract "Validated Idea" into a "Ready for Dev" specification.
*   **Time Saved:** ~10 hours of technical planning, diagramming, and debating stack choices.

## 📝 Agent 5: The Summary Agent
### *Alias: "The Closer"*

> **"I've packaged everything for the leadership team. You look great."**

*   **Role:** Executive Assistant / Chief of Staff
*   **Specialty:** Synthesis & Communication
*   **Job Description:** They take the raw data from all previous agents—problem statements, market research, risk logs, and architecture specs—and weave them into a single, cohesive Executive Summary with visualizations.
*   **The Value:** Makes you look prepared, professional, and data-driven in front of stakeholders.
*   **Time Saved:** ~3 hours of report writing and formatting.
