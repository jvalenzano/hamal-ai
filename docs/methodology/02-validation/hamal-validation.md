# Hamal Validation Report

> **Idea:** Hamal - The Solopreneur Idea Factory Framework.

## 1. Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)
*   **Avatar:** "Builder Ben"
*   **Role:** Senior Engineer / Tech Lead / Indie Hacker.
*   **Pain:** Has 50 domain names bought but 0 profitable products. Loves coding but hates marketing/sales.
*   **Goal:** Wants to quit his job or build a side income but is terrified of building the wrong thing.
*   **Budget:** Willing to pay for *speed* and *certainty* (e.g., $50-$100 for a course/template, or subscription for a tool).

## 2. Risk Register (Top 3 Risks)

| Risk | Impact | Validation Experiment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Users won't trust an AI's opinion.** | High | **Concierge MVP:** Run a manual validation service using the prompts and see if users agree with the output. |
| **2. Users just want to build, not plan.** | Medium | **Landing Page Test:** Test headline "Stop Coding, Start Validating" vs "Build Your Idea Faster". |
| **3. The framework is too complex to set up.** | Medium | **Usability Test:** Give the markdown templates to a junior dev and see if they can run it. |

## 3. The "Mom Test" Simulation
*   **Criticism:** "Why do I need a framework? I can just ask ChatGPT."
*   **Counter:** ChatGPT gives generic, sycophantic advice ("Great idea!"). Hamal agents are prompted to be critical, rigorous, and data-driven (simulating a VC or skeptical buyer).

## 4. Validation Score: 8.5/10
*   **Desirability:** High (Pain is real).
*   **Feasibility:** High (Text-based framework).
*   **Viability:** TBD (Methodology vs SaaS).

## Recommendation
**PROCEED as METHODOLOGY first.**
The "Risk #3" (Complexity) is best mitigated by releasing the docs/templates first. If people struggle to use the Markdown version, a SaaS wrapper won't fix the core workflow. Validate the *process* by sharing the repo/docs.
