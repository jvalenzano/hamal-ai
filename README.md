# HAMAL: The Solopreneur Idea Factory 🏭

> "We shape our tools, and thereafter our tools shape us." —Marshall McLuhan

**Hamal** shapes how solopreneurs think about ideas—structured, validated, and ready to build.

**Hamal** is the **Solopreneur Idea Factory**. It is an AI-powered framework designed to help entrepreneurs rationalize, iterate, research, and validate ideas before committing to code.

> **Hamal** (the star) guides the way. **Hamal** (the methodology) guides your venture.

### The Problem
Solopreneurs have too many ideas and not enough time to validate them. We dive into coding "cool tech" without verifying if anyone needs it. Hamal solves this by providing a structured, agentic workflow to go from "Shower Thought" to "Go/No-Go Decision" rapidly.

### The Solution
Hamal provides an agentic workflow framework that moves ideas through structured phases: Research → Validation → Architecture → Prototyping → Decision. Each phase uses AI agents to accelerate learning while keeping you in control.

### Why Hamal, Why Now?
AI agents can now do the research, analysis, and documentation work that used to take weeks. Hamal orchestrates these agents into a repeatable validation process, turning your idea pipeline into a competitive advantage.

### Flagship Example: Project Echo 🧠
To demonstrate Hamal's capabilities, we are using it to build **Echo**:
> **Echo** is a hands-free "Second Brain" that captures voice and ambient context, processes it through an AI agent, and syncs directly to your **Obsidian Vault**—no screen required.

Echo serves as the primary test case for the Hamal framework, proving that the system can handle complex, hardware-integrated product incubation.

### Project Status: Active Development 🚧
We are currently **building with the Hamal methodology** and using Echo as the flagship case study. The framework, tools, and lessons learned will be open-sourced as we validate the approach.
