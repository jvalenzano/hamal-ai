# Source Code (Production)

> **⚠️ NOTE:** This directory is currently empty by design.

As of **Phase 1 (Ideation)**, all code development happens in `../prototypes/`.

## The Graduation Criteria
Code moves here ONLY when:
1.  The core logic has been validated in a prototype.
2.  The architecture has been defined in an ADR (`../directives/architecture_decisions/`).
3.  The user has explicitly approved the "Promotion" step.

## Intended Structure (Future)
*   `mobile_app/`: React Native / Swift
*   `hardware_firmware/`: Device code
*   `cloud_agent/`: The Brain (Python/FastAPI)
