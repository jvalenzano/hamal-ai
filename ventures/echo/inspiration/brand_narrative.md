# THE ECHO MANIFESTO

**The screen has become a wall.**

We built "Second Brains" to help us think better, but we trapped them inside glowing rectangles. To access our own wisdom, we have to disconnect from the world around us. We have to look down, tap glass, and scroll.

**We believe there is a better way.**

Imagine a second brain that exists in the air around you.
- One that listens when you speak.
- One that nudges you gently when a friend is near.
- One that remembers the book you read three years ago when you're standing in a bookstore today.

**This is Echo.**

Echo is not about "optimizing productivity." It is about **resonance**. It is about letting your past thoughts resonate with your present reality.

We are building Echo because we want to look up. We want to be in nature, in conversation, in flow—while still having the full power of our digital memory at our fingertips.

The future of AI isn't a chatbot. It's a quiet voice in your ear, reminding you of who you wanted to be.
