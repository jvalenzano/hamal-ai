# Prototypes (The Sandbox)

**"Build to Throw Away"**

This directory is for logic experiments, Proof-of-Concepts (POCs), and "Spikes".

## Rules of Engagement
1.  **Code here is messy.** It does not need to be production-ready.
2.  **Focus on "Why" and "If".** (e.g., "If we use Whisper API, is it fast enough?")
3.  **Graduate on Success.** If a prototype offers value, refactor it and move it to `../src/`.
4.  **Delete on Failure.** If an experiment fails, delete it or archive it in a `_graveyard/` folder (if you must).

## Current Active Experiments
*   `voice_capture_poc/`: Testing audio capture/transcription chains.
*   `obsidian_plugin/`: Testing writing to local Obsidian vaults.
